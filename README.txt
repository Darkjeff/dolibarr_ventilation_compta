===== DESCRIPTION =====

This module was created to export accounting data from Dolibarr to all (we try) accouting software. These exports are in csv format in order to be easily import by accounting software. 
Export is possible though Journal Sales Journal Purchases or Journal banking or directly via the ledger
If a line has not been codified in Dolibarr upstream, a suspense account exists but it is especially possible to ventilate the accounting line or accounting lines via this module. 
This module is suitable for so-called "commitment" accounting and respects French accounting standards.

===== FEATURES - WHAT IT CAN DO =====



===== INSTALL =====

Just as any Dolibarr's module, just unzip the contents of this package inside your dolibarr's folder (you should be asked to overwrite some files if done right).

ATTENTION: you need a MySQL database with INNODB. With MySQL >= 5.5, INNODB is default, for MySQL < 5.5 it is MyISAM so you'll have to manually switch to InnoDB. PostgreSQL MAY be supported, we just didn't try yet.
